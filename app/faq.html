					</div>
					<p>If you did not find the answer to your question here, you can contact the technical support of the service<a href="https://t.me/FlirtuHelpBot" target="_blank">@FlirtuHelpBot.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
			
						Please formulate your question in advance - describe what happened to you, what is the problem and what
						exactly is not clear to you, if necessary, attach a screenshot of the screen.</p>
			
					<p>Appeals like “everything is bad”, “what to do”, “I don’t understand”, “help me, I’m not working” and others
						that do not contain a clear description of the problem will not be considered.</p>
					<p>
						Voice messages and messages sent in secret chat will also not be considered.</p>
			
					<h3 id="1">What is @Flirtu_bot?</h3>
					<p>@Flirtu_bot is a dating service.
						Here you can find new friends, casual communication or the love of your life.
						Please note - we do not provide people. We provide only a software product that allows people to
						independently post
						information about themselves, select a couple, communicate and perform other actions aimed at getting to
						know and
						communicating with other people. Users on their own create their profiles and decide how to use them and
						with whom
						to communicate.</p>
			
					<h3 id="2">🔞STORIES section - how does it work?</h3>
					<p>This section is the easiest to use. View photo stories of other users and write to whom you want. Your
						messages will
						be anonymous, and it is up to you to decide whether to disclose incognito or not. You can also publish your
						photo
						story so that they write to you.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="3">START section - how does it work?</h3>
					<p>You press the bot button ✳️START ✳️ and look through the profiles of those who are also looking for a couple.
						Give a 💚 for the ones you like.
						When they also give you a 💚, both of you will receive a message about 💞 mutual sympathy and 💌 a link to a
						chat
						where you can chat directly.
						It doesn't matter who likes first and who likes second, the important thing is that you both do it.
						If you do not want to wait, then you can use paid services (
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#8">What is the Likes you section?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#9">What is a VIP subscription and what benefits does it provide?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#13">What are Gifts and what are they for?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#14">What is the Priority function and what is it for?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#15">What are coins and what are they for?</a>
						) to increase your popularity or
						simplify
						the dating process.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="4">I put ❌ instead of 💚, how can I change my mind?</h3>
					<p>No way. Once an assessment has been made, it cannot be changed or cancelled.
						So, if in doubt - better put 💚. You can stop chatting later.</p>
			
					<h3 id="5">Matches - why can't I chat with people I like right away?</h3>
					<p>Because sympathy should be MUTUAL.
						It's not enough just for you to give someone 💚. This person should also rate you with 💚.
						It doesn't matter who puts 💚 first and who puts 💚 second, the important thing is that you BOTH do it. Only
						then
						will you have a match of likes, after which you both will receive a message about 💞mutual sympathy and a
						💌link to
						a chat where you can chat directly.</p>
			
					<h3 id="6">Why do I get a chat link after a match, but not a Telegram contact?</h3>
					<p>User contacts are personal information, we cannot distribute them. Only the users themselves can decide who
						to share
						their contacts with.
						Chat is an opportunity to communicate with the interlocutor and decide whether you want to continue
						communication
						and give your contacts.</p>
			
					<h3 id="7">How to send messages?</h3>
					<p>To send a message to your match (<a class="anchor-link" href="#5">Matches - why can't I chat with people I
						like right away</a>), go to the Matches section and click the "Open Chat" button below the
						person's
						photo.
						To send messages to story authors (<a class="anchor-link" href="#2">🔞STORIES section - how does it
							work?</a>), go to the Stories section, select a story, and click the "Send
						Anonymous
						Message" button.
						To access your chats, you can also use the 💌button in the main menu of the bot.</p>
			
					<h3 id="8">What is the Likes you section?</h3>
					<p>💗 Likes you is a section where the profiles of ONLY those people who ALREADY liked you are selected. If you
						don’t
						want to look at Start all the profiles that match your search conditions, or don’t want to wait until
						someone you
						like sees and likes you in response, in this section you can choose from those who have already put you 💚
						and
						immediately get match + 💌 chatlink to talk. (The Likes you section is fully available only to VIP users.
						For the
						rest, the use of this section is limited, not all users are available for rating)
			
						The "💗 Likes you" button is located in the main menu, at the bottom right under the ✳️START ✳️ button
						<img src="//d33tflfwlj5scn.cloudfront.net/static/assets/img/faq-menu-en.png" alt="" class="faq-img">
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="9">What is a VIP subscription and what benefits does it provide?</h3>
					<p>With VIP status you will receive:<br>
						✅ Access to the section "Likes you"<br>
						✅ Unlimited viewing of candidates<br>
						✅ Access to the filters of the “Stories” section<br>
						✅ More mutual likes<br>
						✅ 1,000 coins every month<br>
						✅ Personal technical support<br>
						✅ No ads<br>
						Subscription automatically renews at the end of the paid period.<br>
						When connecting a subscription, the user agrees to subsequent payments.<br>
						Only bank cards are accepted for payment.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="10">How to become a VIP?</h3>
					<p>Click the bot buttons Settings - VIP. There you can learn more about the VIP subscription and choose the
						terms of
						connection.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="11">How to get VIP for free?</h3>
					<p>There is currently no such feature. Perhaps this will appear later.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="12">How to disable the VIP subscription?</h3>
					<p>Here's what to do:
						Click the bot buttons Settings - VIP. The bot will inform you about the duration of your VIP membership.
						Under this
						message there will be a button to enter the payment system portal. There you have to turn off subscription
						renewal
						yourself.
						If you turn off the renewal, the subscription will be valid until the end of the paid period.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="13">What are Gifts and what are they for?</h3>
					<p>🎁A gift is a way to attract the attention of your sympathy and offer him / her your candidacy for evaluation
						immediately, at the time of sending the gift, and not in the general display. Moreover, if your application
						was
						initially rejected, the gift will give your sympathy the opportunity to change their mind. It is necessary
						to send a
						gift INSTEAD OF 💚. Upon registration, we give you 100 coins to try it.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="14">What is the Priority function and what is it for?</h3>
					<p>🚀Priority is a feature that promotes your profile to priority places in the display for all users, and they
						see you
						out of turn. You will immediately notice how your popularity and the number of likes have increased.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="15">What are coins and what are they for?</h3>
					<p>Coins are the bot's currency for purchasing/opening additional paid services that can speed up and facilitate
						the
						dating process or increase your popularity, such as Gifts (<a class="anchor-link" href="#13">What are Gifts
							and what are they for?</a>) and Priority (<a class="anchor-link" href="#14">What is the Priority
							function and what is it for?</a>)
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="16">How to get coins?</h3>
					<p>You need to go to the 💰Coins section. Your balance is indicated there and there are detailed instructions on
						how to
						get them, what they can be spent on.
						Or you can sign up for a VIP subscription and receive 1000 coins every month as a gift for the entire
						duration of
						the subscription.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="17">How to earn coins (get free)?</h3>
					<p>There is currently no such feature. Perhaps she will appear later.
					</p>
			
					<h3 id="18">Why am I being forced to pay?</h3>
					<p>You are not forced to pay. All basic functionality (<a class="anchor-link" href="#2">🔞STORIES section - how
						does it work?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#3">START section - how does it work?</a>), necessary for getting to know each
						other, is
						available for free. Only additional services (<a class="anchor-link" href="#8">What is the Likes you
							section?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#9">What is a VIP subscription and what benefits does it provide?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#13">What are Gifts and what are they for?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#14">What is the Priority function and what is it for?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#15">What are coins and what are they for?</a>) are paid. To use paid services
						or not is
						absolutely your
						desire and decision.
					</p>
					<h3 id="19">How can I meet people for free?</h3>
					<p>Please use the free sections ✳️START ✳️ (<a class="anchor-link" href="#3">START section - how does it
						work?</a>) and 🔞Stories (<a class="anchor-link" href="#2">🔞STORIES section - how does it work?</a>).
						The 💗Likes you section (<a class="anchor-link" href="#8">What is the Likes you section?</a>) is also
						partially available for free.</p>
					<h3 id="20">We had a match, I wrote to the chat, but they don’t answer me - why?</h3>
					<p>Only those who do not answer you can answer this question.
						When a message is received, the user receives an audible notification of the incoming message, as well as an
						indication of unread messages in the main menu buttons.
						They can not answer for many reasons - perhaps this person is busy now, is not constantly in the bot, or has
						already
						met someone else. We cannot force users to respond to you or know the reasons for their silence.
					</p>
					<h3 id="21">Almost no one likes me, I have few matches - what should I do?</h3>
					<p>Make sure that your profile looks attractive and interesting: upload a good, really good selfie, bright,
						unusual.
						Fill out the "About" section - write a little about what kind of relationship you are looking for, your
						tastes and
						interests.
						You can also use additional features (<a class="anchor-link" href="#8">What is the Likes you section?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#9">What is a VIP subscription and what benefits does it provide?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#13">What are Gifts and what are they for?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#14">What is the Priority function and what is it for?</a>,
						<a class="anchor-link" href="#15">What are coins and what are they for?</a>) to increase your popularity and
						get other benefits.</p>
					<h3 id="22">Why was my photo rejected or my account blocked?</h3>
					<p>Because this photo or other profile data does not comply with the rules of the service.
						For example - an image or other profile data of poor quality / does not contain a person / taken from the
						Internet /
						contains addresses or contacts / refers to a person under the age of 18 or a child / contains advertising or
						sales
						offers, etc.
						For a more specific answer related specifically to your situation, you should contact the Technical support
						service
						at <a href="https://t.me/FlirtuHelpBot" target="_blank">@FlirtuHelpBot</a></p>
					<h3 id="23">What should my profile be like?</h3>
					<p>Since this is a dating service, you must set your own photo in your profile. Not a joke, not art, not a photo
						of other people or animals, and so on. The photo must show you, in clothes, your face must be visible. The
						photo
						itself must be of good quality. Your account must not contain erotica, advertising, threats, insults or
						other
						negative content.
						You can post pictures and other photos of interest to Stories, but your profile photo must meet the
						requirements
						above.
					</p>
					<h3 id="24">How can I customize my profile?</h3>
					<p>To view or customize your profile, please click the bot buttons ⚙️Settings - My Profile
					</p>
					<h3 id="25">How can I customize my search?</h3>
					<p>To view or customize your search, please click the bot buttons ⚙️Settings - Search settings
					</p>
					<h3 id="26">At what age can you use the service?</h3>
					<p>From 18 years old.
					</p>
					<h3 id="27">How to delete a profile?</h3>
					<p>To delete a profile, you need to send a request to the technical support service at <a href="https://t.me/FlirtuHelpBot" target="_blank">@FlirtuHelpBot</a>.
						Also, please indicate the reason for the removal - it is very important for us to know this in order to
						improve the
						service.
						Please note: stopping the bot does not result in the deletion of the profile.
						If you are a VIP user, please disable your VIP subscription ( <a class="anchor-link" href="#12"> How to
							disable the VIP subscription?</a>
						) before requesting deletion and, if
						necessary,
						notify the technical support staff about this.
					</p>
					<h3 id="28">I want to report another user</h3>
					<p>If you would like to report a user, please send a screenshot of their profile and proof of your allegations
						to
						Technical Support at <a href="https://t.me/FlirtuHelpBot" target="_blank">@FlirtuHelpBot</a> . After
						verification, a decision about blocking the user will be made.
					</p>
					<h3 id="29">My bot control buttons are missing</h3>
					<p>If your bot control buttons are missing or the bot is not responding to your commands, you may have switched
						to the
						keyboard, stopped the bot, or blocked it.
						To switch from the keyboard, click here:
						<img width="500" src="//d33tflfwlj5scn.cloudfront.net/static/assets/img/faq-tg-ui.png" alt="" class="faq-img"><br>
			
						To restart the bot, click on the name of the bot at the top of the screen, then on the 3 dots in the upper
						right
						corner and select "restart bot" in the menu that opens. This is the most frequent, but not the only location
						of the
						required menu. It may be different depending on your device model or Telegram version.
						If you are unable to solve the problem yourself, please contact the Technical support of the service at
						<a href="https://t.me/FlirtuHelpBot" target="_blank">@FlirtuHelpBot</a>
					</p>
					<h3 id="30">Where can I learn more about the terms and conditions of using the service?</h3>
					<p>You can read the Terms of Use (<a href="https://flirtu.io/agreement/" target="_blank">https://flirtu.io/agreement/</a>)
						and Privacy Policy
						(<a href="https://flirtu.io/en/privacy/" target="_blank">https://flirtu.io/privacy/</a>)
					</p>
					<h3 id="31">If you did not find the answer to your question here, you can contact the technical support operator
						<a href="https://t.me/FlirtuHelpBot" target="_blank">@FlirtuHelpBot</a></h3>
					<p>Please formulate your question in advance - describe what happened to you, what is the problem and what
						exactly you
						do not understand, if necessary, attach a screenshot of the screen. Applications that do not contain a
						description
						of the problem will not be considered.
